# Vanilla JS Parallax Backgrounds

Second project out of nine from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-game-development-full-course/) to learn game development with Vanilla Javascript.

In this project we learn how to work with parallax background and how to implement five different backgrounds layers - with player customizable speed - all tied to the same game speed variable but each one with is own speed.
